One of the aims of Kerbit is to help tackle recycling contamination problems in Leeds. Because of this it is important to understand the ability of technology, such as apps, to incite positive behaviour change and how software can be used for social influence as what Kerbit is effectively aiming to do is change the behaviour of residents that are placing the waste into the wrong bins or not taking appropriate items to the recycling centre. While much of the research into the ability of apps to affect behaviour change is in relation to health apps or m-Health, their conclusions and ideas are applicable to Kerbit as it too aims to effect behaviour.

Helf and Hlavac's (2016) review of health apps and their ability to accomplish behaviour change came to the conclusion that apps are 'an important delivery vehicle for behavioural change' (Helf and Hlavac, 2016, p.21). Additionally, Oduor et al's (2014) research into persuaive systems and software designs found that software, like apps and websites could 'sustain longterm behaviour change' (Oduor et al, 2014, p.14). Conclusions of this type are important the creation of an app to aid in the process of recycling as it provides support that Kerbit can be successful in its aim of helping tackle recycling contamination by effectively changing the behaviour of its users.

However, much research emphasises the importance of gamification as a motivational and persuasive trigger (Pereira et al, 2014) in the ability of an app to incite positive behaviour change. While upon first glance it would appear that Kerbit lacks this feature thus could be argued to not be efficient in creating or guiding behaviour change, opposingly, it could also be argued that the addition of artificial intelligence and machine learning would be enough of a draw for uses due to it uniqueness, thus being in itself its own persuasive feature.
