Artificial intelligence is a term for a broad range of tools used for making computers and computer systems behave intelligently, this includes a wide range of things like voice assistants and recommendations systems. (Bowne-Anderson, 2020). Machine learning comes under the category of AI tools as it is a 'branch of artificial intelligence which deals with the design and the development of algorithms and techniques to help machines learn' (Mellouk and Chebira, 2009, p.vii) from exisiting data and then have the ability to apply the learning to new data. These technologies have 'revolutionalized the world as we know it in the past decade' (Stewart, 2019) due to the rapid increase in the quanitities of data available caused by the increasing digitisation of daily life and the 'rapid development of processor power and computer parallelization' (Stewart, 2019) has made the usage of huge amounts of data far easier than every before. With the rise of AI powered sevices and ubiquitous computing it is important to research and understand the state of the technology within artificial intelligence, as well as the possibilities machine learning. Both over the industry use of these technologies as to gain background knowledge of the standard ot which these tools are created to within the industry and within the context of the aims of the development of Kerbit so that the intended function of the application is proven viable as well.

The specific type of model that Kerbit will be implementing is an image classification model, it is trained on various categories of images with the goal of identitifying what the image represents (Tensorflow,2020) by returing a probability score for each category.
