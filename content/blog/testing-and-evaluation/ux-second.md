### Specific app views

**First page**

_User responses:_

1. Not clear that the ? button hides that section
2. Find it odd that you are still able to take a photo when in the help bit
3. Nothing happens when you deny the camera access, and I can still take a photo

_Changes/Actions:_

1. Create a new icon that it more representative, user tester suggested a cross or down button
2. Will disable the shutter button when the help tab is active
3. An alert will be added letting the user know that they have to allow camera access to use Kerbit

**Help section**

_User responses:_

1. Thought the icons in the How To section were buttons
2. In the Kerbit Knows section, the icon next to the text about messaging them should be the same message button

_Changes/Actions:_

1.  These will be changed to something that is more representative of a step by step walk through
2.  This icon will be swapped out for the same message button from the main control bar and will link out to the contact page as well

**Contact page**

_User responses:_

1. Unable to scroll, cannot get to the submit button

_Changes/Actions_

1.  This minor bug will be fixed

These changes and actions will be implemented in the coming days and another post will be written to outline all the changed made.
