After completing the prototype, experiencing the time needed to generate enough data to train a sufficient model, and taking time to resort over the different categories of recyclables on the Leeds.gov website, I have reevaluated what categories are necessary for Kerbit to be a functional product as well as minimising the number of categories that need to be made.


### Categories for green bin recyclables
All these items are in the category of things that can be placed in the green bin that users will have at their home.

 - Paper (covering post, packing paper, newspapers etc)
 - Cardboard (covering packaging, cereal boxes etc)
 - Metal (covering tin cans, aerosols, foil etc)
 - Plastics (covering bags, cartons/tetrapaks/food tubs etc)

### Categories of recycling centre recyclables
All these items are things that are either: broad categories of items that should be taken to recycling centres or charity shops or specific categories of items that are often mistaken for being able to be put in the green bin but actually have to be taken to a refuse centre or have to go into general waste.

*Broad categories*

- Glass (covering all bottles, jars, cups etc)
- Furniture
- Homewares* (covering items like kitchen wear and home decorations)
- Electricals (covering items such as toasters, kettles, tv's)
-	Textiles (covering items such as clothing, bedding, soft furnishing)


\* *this may need to be further segmented if there are high percentages of confusion during model training, could be separated into items such as crockery, pots and pans etc.*

*Specific categories*

- Disposable cups
- Batteries
- Lightbulbs
- Crisp Packets
