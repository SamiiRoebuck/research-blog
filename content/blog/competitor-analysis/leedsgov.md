The Leeds Council website is the official source of recycling information for residents within the Leeds area.

---

### _Issue_

It provides all the information needed, however the long pages of bullet points combined with the lack of a search function that searches just the recycling information it can be quite difficult to get through and hard to find the required information quickly.

### _Fix_

Kerbit will make this information easier to access by only showing the recycling information related to the items that the user is concerned with.

---

### _Issue_

The site is responsive and works on mobile, however it is clearly not fully optimised for mobile use as the aforementioned long lists of bullet point do make for extremely long pages to scroll through when on a mobile device.

### _Fix_

As Kerbit will be a PWA it will be designed and built fully mobile focused, with the content and user interface fully optimised for smaller screens.

---

### _Issue_

While this competitor does provide all the information necessary, the minimal styling, large sections of copy and long scrolling pages do not make it great for user experience.

### _Fix_

Kerbit aims to make the task of recycling easier for people by making the UX as clear as possible.
