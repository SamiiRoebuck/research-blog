## Intended features required from the API

| MoSCoW   | Feature                                                                      | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Google AutoML | IBM Watson |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Must     | Work with Tensorflow.js                                                      | this is the library that makes using image classification models in web apps using JavaScript possible                                                                                                                                                                                                     | &#x2611;      | &#x2611;   |
| Must     | Have the option for cloud/virtual machines being used for the model training | Because my laptop doesn't have the compute power to train a comprehensive model in a acceptable amount of time                                                                                                                                                                                             | &#x2611;      | &#x2611;   |
| Must     | Be well documented with a good amount of information online about use cases  | Because I am new to using this kind of technology having a good bank of information to use will be beneficial as it is pretty much a given that I will run into issues/bugs                                                                                                                                | &#x2611;      | &#x2612;   |
| Should   | Have a usable GUI for training the model as well as a well documented CLI    | Because although I am confident using CLI's, a good GUI will speed up the process                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | &#x2611;      | &#x2612;   |
| Should   | Have a free tier for experimenting with and reasonable pricing for later use | Because having a certain amount of compute hours for free will be helpful to determine the quality of the trained model without having to invest capital, and having a reasonable price for higher level use is important as as a student I don't have the expendable income to support high cost API fees | &#x2611;      | &#x2611;   |
| Could    | A base model that has already been pre-trained that can be extended upon     | Because having a model that can be built upon rather than starting from scratch will be quicker                                                                                                                                                                                                            | &#x2612;      | &#x2612;   |
| Will not | Have the model being deployed only on the cloud                              | As the web app will be a PWA, the model will need to be downloaded and deployed for edge devices to work offline                                                                                                                                                                                           | &#x2612;      | &#x2611;   |

From this MoSCoW analyse of the two most popular tools for creating custom machine learning models, it is clear that the most logical option to go for is Google AutoML, this is due to the Google API meeting all of the must have features and IBM Watson only being able to deploy models on the cloud which is not suitable for this project.
