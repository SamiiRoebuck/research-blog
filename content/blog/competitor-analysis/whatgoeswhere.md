What Goes Where provides the same informations as the Leeds Council website in a more interesting way. The site includes additional features that the prior competitor doesn’t, such as animations and the user of colour.

---

### _Issue_

While the information is displayed in a more user-friendly way, with common items such as tins and cardboard being easily accessible in one click, the pages do eventually redirect to the Leeds Council website if the user requires more information so still suffers from the same issues of having long pages of bullet points that the prior competitor does.

### _Fix_

Kerbit will implement these features that enhance user experience, such as animations, and combine it with giving the user access to simple information.

---

### _Issue_

The site seems to be designed primarily for mobile with it simply being scaled up with an added background gradient on desktop.

### _Fix_

Kerbit will take advantage of the desktop platform by having a website that advertises the app and gives the option of downloading the app, rather than just scaling it up.

While this competitor provides the user the needed information in an arguably more interesting way, it still doesn’t provide the optimum experience for the user.
