Recyclenow is the most similar to the intended functions of Kerbit, allowing users to find where to recycle specific items, where recycling centres are based on their location and what items go in which household waste bin.
This website also has the same issue as the prior two with the user having to be directed to long pages of bullet points, in this case there is an A-Z of items that can be recycled which is not very appealing to navigate through.

### _Feature_

It has the most appealing styling of the all the competitors, with a clean colour palette used consistently throughout the site and uses green shades throughout to bring in the connotations of the environment. Kerbit will emulate this clean design and colour choices within the app.

---

### _Issue_

While this site is, in many ways, an improvement on the prior two, it still lacks the conciseness, ease of use and implementation of modern technologies that Kerbit aims to offer users.

### _Fix_

The development of Kerbit will draw on the strengths and weakness of these competitors to ensure that the end user has the best possible experience.
